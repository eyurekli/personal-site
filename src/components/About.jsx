                I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at 
                <a href="https://www.dal.ca/" id="index-a"> Dalhousie University</a> with 
                 a passion for web development.

                        I have lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 16 years, up until I decided that I want to be part of a bigger and better education system. 
                        I have chosen to finish my high school studies in Harrison Trimble High School, in Moncton, NB, Canada.

                        After graduating from HTHS, I am now on my journey of pursuing a Computer Science degree,
                        at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. Currently completed the Fall term of 2nd year.

                        I play a lot of games. Sonic and Ace Attorney are my favourite series.
                        I used to be crazy about Model United Nations. I helped revive and run the DalMUN Society in 23/24.
                        I love doing sports to stay active. I like going to the gym, I'm a active member of the Dal Run Club.
                        I occasionally join the Dal Football Club, though I like Basketball as a sport more.
                        I'm a big fan of Fenerbah√ße from my hometown Istanbul.
